# Programming_Fundamentals-PF-_Final_Project
🎮 GameMania 🎮
📌 Project Overview

GameMania is a console-based Java application developed as the final project for the First Semester Programming course at COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI).
The project combines multiple mini-games into a single menu-driven program, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts through an interactive user experience.

🕹️ Games Included :

GameMania offers the following games:

• Tic Tac Toe

  Player vs Player mode

  Player vs Computer mode

• Rock Paper Scissors

• Hangman

  Random word selection from a file

  ASCII-based visual representation

• Dice Roll Simulator

  Supports rolling multiple dice with visual output

⚙️ Features :

• Menu-driven console interface

• Use of methods for modular design

• Implementation of loops, conditions, and arrays

• File handling for the Hangman game

• Randomized gameplay using Java’s Random class

• ASCII art and colored console output for better user interaction

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated :

This project demonstrates core programming fundamentals, including:

• Variables and data types

• Conditional statements (if, switch)

• Loops (for, while)

• Arrays and ArrayLists

• Methods and modular programming

• File handling (BufferedReader, FileReader)

• User input handling with Scanner

• Basic error handling

🛠️ Technologies Used : 

Language: Java

IDE: Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / NetBeans)

Java Version: Java 8 or above

▶️ How to Run the Project:

Clone or download the repository

Make sure Java is installed on your system

Place the words.txt file in the same directory as the program (required for Hangman)

Compile and run the program:
